Any readable phrase you have seen so far has been withdrawn from a language package which contains all data and phrases for the language in question. Language packages are stored in XML files and can be manually modified, downloaded, and replaced. This section lists the available packages to be selected and used by your system. You are able to access the `language` folder in the home directory for manual modifications or uploads. Note that over time new features are added, and naturally new phrases are added to language packages, hence it's recommended to keep an eye on the package compatibility to ensure it suits your current system version. Extentions use seperate language packages.</acp_m_system_language_info_txt>
