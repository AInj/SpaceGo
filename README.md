# SpaceGo
SpaceGo is an open-source modular CMS with a hybrid framework powered by PHP & released under MIT License to offer developers the foundations of new web projects. SpaceGo is comprised of necessary tools for a web project development but does not aim to become another CMS or compete the ones out there, coming with a different approach and ideology.

SpaceGo is given to developers as a dynamic, flexible system with a set of tools and libraries to modify and expand it in accordance to their own needs. While SpaceGo provides libraries for language and theme processing, it is also backed by GUI-based Admin Control Panel which is integrated with the entire system core and controls all features.

## Extensions
The heart of SpaceGo is extensions (or plugins) designated to extend the abilities of the system and add new features. While the initial release of SpaceGo includes a couple of basic extensions with standard features, additional extensions can be developed easily and distributed freely by the community or by a single developer for specific project needs.

The extensions engine is embedded directly to the system core, allowing extension developers to access and use all of the built-in features of SpaceGo or other activated third party extensions.
